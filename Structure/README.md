# # AirSlay717: Structure Team

## Team Main Mission

The group's main mission is to physically restore the UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) structure, ensuring optimal flight conditions in all phases. 

## Framework and Motivation
In the scope of the curricular unit Aerospace Project, the students must repair and upgrade an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), providing it with all the required abilities to perform a flight under different operational conditions.
This challenge follows a Project Learning-based approach to building knowledge by integrating the skills developed in the remaining curricular units of the Aerospace Engineering study plan to operationalize the UAV.
The UAV repair and upgrade tasks were split into three main work packages: Structure, Propulsion, and Avionics. 
Leading the Structures Work Package, the team's primary purpose is to repair and optimize the UAV structural elements, namely the fuselage, wings, landing gear, and rear stabilizers. To achieve the established goal, the group must analyze the structure in its current state, identify the elements with the potential to be optimized considering their functional role and impact on the overall system, and repair/ replace the damaged components.
The mission's success strongly depends on the cooperation between the groups responsible for the different domains, constituting a perfect representation of the actual scenario in an industrial/organizational context.
