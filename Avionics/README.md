# # AirSlay717: AVIONICS team
**Main Mission Definition**

The group's main mission is to develop the avionics system for the UAV (Unmanned Aerial
Vehicle) Hangar 9 Solo Trainer, that provides the necessary support to guarantee the
efficient operation of the aircraft during all phases of the flight, and that meets the specific
objectives of the aircraft, providing safety, control and good performance throughout its
operating period.

**Framework and Motivation**

Within the scope of the Projeto Aeroespacial Curricular Unit, we were proposed to restore
the UAV Hangar 9 Solo Trainer, specifically the reconstruction of the avionics system. The
avionics system is responsible for integrating various electronic components and control
systems that aim to meet the specific objectives of the aircraft, with the intention of allowing
its operation and execution of specific tasks. These systems play a critical role in the control,
navigation, communication and execution of unmanned aircraft missions.
The compromised state of the aircraft provides motivation for the group to achieve the ideal
flight state, with the avionics system being the essential part that enables the aircraft to
function. Developing an avionics system could become an interesting challenge, as it is a
learning opportunity in areas such as electronics, programming and aerodynamics.
