# # AirSlay717: Reviving the Skies

Welcome to the official GitHub repository for AirSlay717, a class project passionately undertaken by first-year students of the **Master's Program in Aerospace Engineering** at the [University of Minho](https://www.uminho.pt/). This project, a cornerstone of our academic journey for the year 2023-2024, is conducted under the "Aerospace Project" course.

## Project Overview

AirSlay717 is more than just an academic project. It is our mission to restore a Radio-Controlled (RC) plane to its former glory, ensuring it not only takes to the skies again but also becomes a beacon for future aerospace innovations. This project is divided into three working teams, each bringing a unique skill set and perspective to the table:

- **Structure Team**: Focused on the physical integrity and aerodynamics of the plane, ensuring it is built to fly.
- **Propulsion Team**: Dedicated to the heart of the plane, fine-tuning the engine and propulsion system for optimal performance.
- **Avionics Team**: Concentrated on the brains of the operation, implementing cutting-edge electronics for navigation and control.

## Goals and Vision

Our primary goal is straightforward yet challenging: to restore the RC plane to fully operational and flying conditions. However, the project vision extends beyond mere restoration. We aim to establish a base framework for future class projects, potentially exploring autonomous flight and data acquisition during flight.

## Repository Contents

This GitHub repository is your one-stop destination for all things AirSlay717. Here, you will find:

- **Project Updates**: Regular posts detailing our progress, challenges, and milestones.
- **Changelogs**: Documented revisions that track the evolution of our project.
- **Media Gallery**: A vibrant collection of images and videos capturing our journey, from the workshop to the skies.
- **Resource Library**: Technical documents, design plans, and research materials supporting our project.

## Future Aspirations

Upon the successful demonstration of the RC plane's operational capabilities, this repository will evolve its current role. It will become a digital flight logbook, tracking the journey of AirSlay717 from its inaugural flight to future revisions and enhancements. This digital log will serve not only as a testament to the students' work but also as a valuable resource for future students and RC enthusiasts.

## Collaboration and Contributions

As we navigate the complexities of this project, we invite the global community of students, educators, and aerospace enthusiasts to join us in this exciting journey. Your insights, feedback, and encouragement will fuel our progress and inspire future innovations.

Together, let's rise to new heights with AirSlay717. Follow our journey, feel free to contribute and be part of the legacy we're building at the University of Minho.
