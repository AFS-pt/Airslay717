# # AirSlay717: Reviving the Skies

Welcome to the official GitHub repository for AirSlay717, a class project undertaken by first-year students of the **Master's Program in Aerospace Engineering** at the [University of Minho](https://www.uminho.pt/). This project, a cornerstone of our academic journey for the year 2023-2024, is conducted under the "Aerospace Project" course.

## Project Overview

AirSlay717 is more than just an academic project. It is our mission to restore a Radio-Controlled (RC) plane, ensuring it not only takes to the skies again but also becomes a solid framework for future innovations within the program.

In the 2023-24 edition, the class is divided into three working teams, each bringing a unique skill set and perspective to the project:

- **Structure Team**: Focused on the physical integrity, aerodynamics of the plane and performance, and ensuring it is built to fly.
- **Propulsion Team**: Dedicated to the heart of the plane, fine-tuning the engine and propulsion system for optimal performance.
- **Avionics Team**: Concentrated on the remote control of the plane, establishing a suitable and flexible electronic framework, and implementing electronics for navigation and control.

## Goals and Vision

Our primary goal is straightforward: **to restore the RC plane to fully operational and flying conditions**. However, the project vision extends beyond just restoration. We aim to establish a base framework for future class projects, potentially exploring autonomous flight and data acquisition during flight.

## The plane

The centerpiece of our project, AirSlay717, is the Hangar 9 Solo Series Trainer. It is a plane design from early 2000's made of balsa wood. The propulsion of the plane is supported by a Thunder Tiger PRO-46 Aero engine. More information about the plane on the individual team's folders.

## Repository Contents

This GitHub repository is the one-stop destination for all things AirSlay717. Here, you will find:

- **Project Updates**: Regular posts detailing our progress, challenges, and milestones.
- **Changelogs**: Documented revisions that track the evolution of our project.
- **Media Gallery**: A collection of images and videos capturing our journey, from the workshop to the airfield.
- **Resource Library**: Technical documents, design plans, and research materials supporting our project.

## Future Aspirations

Upon the successful demonstration of the RC plane's operational capabilities, this repository will evolve its current role. It will become a digital flight logbook, tracking the journey of AirSlay717 from its inaugural flight to future revisions and enhancements. This digital log will serve not only as a testament to the students' work but also as a valuable resource for future students and RC enthusiasts.

## Collaboration and Contributions

As we navigate this project, we invite the community of students, educators, and enthusiasts to follow us. Your insights, feedback, and suggestions will support our progress and inspire future ideas.

Follow our journey, feel free to contribute and be part of the legacy.
